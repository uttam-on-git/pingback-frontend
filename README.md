    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    - In the root of the project, create a new file named `.env`.
    - Add the following variable, pointing to your local backend server:
      ```env
      VITE_BACKEND_API_URL="http://localhost:3000"
      ```

### Running the Application

## üîë Environment Variables

The following variables need to be set in a `.env` file for the application to work correctly. Note the `VITE_` prefix is required by Vite to expose the variable to the frontend.

| Variable               | Description                                | Example                 |
